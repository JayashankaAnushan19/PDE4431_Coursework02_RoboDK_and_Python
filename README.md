This project focuses on the development of a program to simulate an industrial robotic scenario using **RoboDK** and program the robot with Python. The primary objective of this coursework is to gain practical, hands-on experience with **RoboDK**, enabling the creation of efficient industrial solutions in a virtual environment that can be seamlessly applied to real-world applications ***(Epson VT-6)***.

In addition to simulation, this project dives into the fundamentals of robotics, including the demonstration of robot kinematics through the implementation of *Denavit-Hartenberg (DH)* parameters, which are critical for understanding the motion and configuration of robotic systems.

This project combines theoretical knowledge with practical applications, preparing students for real-world challenges in robotics and automation.

*Below is a demonstration video link showcasing the program and simulation in action:*
